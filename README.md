# Design Pattern

## Object Oriented Design Principles

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same. **Encapsulate what varies.**
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs for objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extention but closed for modification.
